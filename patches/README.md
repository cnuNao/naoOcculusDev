Patches & Hotfixes
==================

Sometimes stuff doesn't work, if using the Ubuntu VM image, these are all of the fixes that have been applied to third party tools used to make / run this project.

###qiBuild

[qiBuild](https://github.com/aldebaran/qibuild) is a CMake wrapper made by Aldebaran to build and run projects. The version of qiBuild used on this VM has a bug that prevents it from targeting the correct path to the binary executable file generated by `qibuild make <project>`. To fix this, the following file(s) have been patched and a copy of the original and patched one have been included in this directory:

- /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/qibuild/run.py
- Original: `./run.py.bak`
- Patched: `./run.py.patch`
